# cmux

cmux runs multiple coding agent CLIs in parallel and gives each run its own isolated workspace with VS Code, terminal, and review tools.

## Choose your app
- Web app: run tasks in cloud workspaces from any browser.
- Desktop app (Electron): adds local workspaces on your machine and supports cloud workspaces too.

## What you get
- Tasks that spawn parallel runs across multiple agents.
- Isolated workspaces with VS Code and terminal per run.
- Git diff review with heatmap and screenshots.
- GitHub pull request creation, review, and merge.
- Environments for reusable cloud setup.
- Activity timeline, notifications, and command bar for navigation.

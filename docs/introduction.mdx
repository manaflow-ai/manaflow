cmux is an open-source AI coding agent orchestrator that allows you to run multiple coding agents in parallel.

## Pick your setup

**Web app** — Works in any browser. Runs tasks in cloud workspaces.

**Desktop app** — Same as web, plus you can run agents locally with Docker.

## What you can do

- **Run agents in parallel** — Pick any combination of Claude, Codex, Gemini, Amp, and more. Each gets its own branch.
- **Watch them work** — Every agent gets a live VS Code session you can see in real time.
- **Review the code** — Side-by-side diffs with AI-powered heatmaps that highlight risky changes.
- **Preview your app** — Cloud workspaces give you a live URL to test UI changes.
- **Open PRs and merge** — Create pull requests and merge directly from cmux.

title: VS Code Workspaces
description: 'Edit each run in a full VS Code web workspace'
---

## Overview
The Workspace panel embeds a VS Code web instance for every run. It opens the run's branch and updates in real time as the agent works. The web app uses cloud workspaces; the desktop app can also open local workspaces when Docker is available.

## Open workspaces
- From the task tree, select a run and open VS Code.
- Use the "Open with" menu to launch VS Code (web) or a local editor when a worktree is available.

## Open with options
Available actions depend on what is installed:
- VS Code (web)
- VS Code (local)
- Cursor
- Windsurf
- Finder
- iTerm
- Terminal
- Ghostty
- Alacritty
- Xcode

## Local workspaces
Local runs use git worktrees on disk (default `~/cmux/...`). The Open With menu opens that worktree in local editors.

## Editor settings sync (web mode)
In Settings > Editor Settings Sync you can upload:
- `settings.json`
- `keybindings.json`
- snippets
- extension list

These settings apply to cloud workspaces for VS Code, Cursor, and Windsurf.

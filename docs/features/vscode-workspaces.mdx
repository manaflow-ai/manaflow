## Real-time editing

Every run gets its own VS Code web instance. Watch agents write code in real time, or jump in and make edits yourself.

## Opening workspaces

From the task tree:
- Select a run to see its workspace
- Use the "Open with" menu for more options

## Open with options

Depending on what you have installed:

| Editor | Type |
|--------|------|
| VS Code (web) | Browser |
| VS Code (local) | Desktop |
| Cursor | Desktop |
| Windsurf | Desktop |
| Finder | File manager |
| iTerm / Terminal / Ghostty / Alacritty | Terminal |
| Xcode | IDE |

<Tip>Local editors open the worktree on disk. You can use your full local setup while cmux handles the branching.</Tip>

## Local workspaces

Local runs use git worktrees at `~/cmux/...` by default. The Open With menu opens that folder in whatever editor you choose.

## Editor settings sync

Want your VS Code settings in cloud workspaces? Go to **Settings > Editor Settings Sync** and upload:
- `settings.json`
- `keybindings.json`
- Snippets
- Extension list

These settings apply to VS Code, Cursor, and Windsurf in cloud workspaces.

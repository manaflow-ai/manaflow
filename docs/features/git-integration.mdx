## Overview
cmux works directly on GitHub repos. Each run uses its own branch and workspace.

## Repos and branches
- Select a GitHub repo and base branch when creating a task.
- cmux creates a new branch for each run and records it on the run.
- Use "Copy branch" in the Open With menu to copy the branch name.

## Diffs
- The Git Diff panel compares the run branch against the base branch.
- The diff view supports heatmap review and screenshot sets (see Code Review).

## Pull requests
- Create PRs from runs; cmux tracks PR URL and state per run.
- The Pull Request view embeds the PR and shows its current state.
- From PR views you can merge or close PRs.

## Auto PR from crown
Enable "Auto-create pull request with the best diff" in Settings > Crown Evaluator to open a PR for the crowned run automatically.

## GitHub access
Connecting GitHub OAuth is required for private repos. Installing the GitHub App enables repo listing and PR operations (see Integrations > GitHub).

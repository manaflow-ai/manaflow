## How it works

cmux works directly with your GitHub repos. When you start a task:

1. You pick a repo and base branch
2. cmux creates a new branch for each agent
3. Each agent works on its own branch
4. You review the diffs and pick a winner

## Branches

Each run gets its own branch, automatically named and tracked. Use "Copy branch" in the Open With menu if you need the branch name.

## Diffs

The Git Diff panel shows exactly what changed:
- Compare any run's branch against the base branch
- AI-powered heatmaps highlight risky changes
- Screenshot comparisons for UI changes (when available)

## Pull requests

Create PRs directly from cmux:
- Open a PR from any completed run
- Track PR status (draft, open, merged, closed)
- Merge or close PRs without leaving cmux

<Tip>Enable "Auto-create pull request with the best diff" in Settings to automatically open a PR for the crowned run.</Tip>

## GitHub access

To work with private repos, you'll need to:

1. **Connect GitHub OAuth** — Go to Settings > Connected Accounts
2. **Install the GitHub App** — Click "Install GitHub App" in the repo picker

The OAuth connection lets you clone private repos. The GitHub App enables repo listing and PR operations.

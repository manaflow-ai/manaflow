## What's an environment?

An environment is a saved cloud workspace that you can reuse. Set it up once with your repos, scripts, and login sessions—then every task starts from that exact state.

## What's included

| Part | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| **Repos** | GitHub repos to clone |
| **Maintenance script** | Runs before the dev script (install deps, etc.) |
| **Dev script** | Starts your dev server |
| **Environment variables** | Secrets and config |
| **Preview settings** | Which services get preview links |
| **Snapshot** | Saved VM state with all of the above |

## Creating an environment

1. Pick your repos (or choose manual setup for a bare VM)
2. Choose a machine size
3. Set up scripts and env vars
4. Run everything in VS Code and sign in to any services you need
5. Save to capture a snapshot

<Tip>The snapshot captures everything—running processes, logged-in sessions, installed packages. Runs start instantly from this state.</Tip>

## Using an environment

When creating a task, select your environment instead of a repo. That's it—cmux handles the rest.

Environment tasks:
- Run in cloud workspaces
- Don't need a base branch
- Use your saved scripts and env vars

## Updating an environment

From the environment page:
- **Modify VM** — Launch a workspace from the current snapshot
- **Create snapshot** — Save your changes as a new version
- **Edit settings** — Change scripts, preview settings, or the name

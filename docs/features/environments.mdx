## Overview
Environments are reusable templates for cloud workspaces. They bundle repos, scripts, env vars, preview settings, and a snapshot so runs start from a known state.

## What an environment contains
- Name and optional description.
- One or more GitHub repos.
- Maintenance script (runs before the dev script).
- Dev script (starts your dev server).
- Environment variables.
- Preview settings that control which services show preview links.
- A snapshot version.

## Create an environment
1. Select repos (or choose manual setup for a bare VM).
2. Pick a machine size.
3. Configure scripts, env vars, and preview settings.
4. In the workspace step, run the scripts in VS Code and use the browser panel to sign in to any required services.
5. Save the environment to capture a snapshot.

## Use an environment
- Select the environment when creating a task.
- Environment tasks run in cloud workspaces and do not require a base branch.
- The environment's scripts and env vars are applied to each run.

## Modify an environment
From the environment detail page you can:
- Launch a "Modify VM" workspace from the active snapshot.
- Create a new snapshot version and activate it.
- Edit scripts, preview settings, and the environment name.

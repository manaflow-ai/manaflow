description: 'Browser preview for cloud workspaces'

## Overview
Live preview is available for cloud workspaces (web app and desktop app in cloud mode). It includes a full browser session and preview links for running services.

## Browser panel
Cloud runs expose a Browser panel backed by a remote browser session. Use it to interact with the app while the agent works.

## Preview links
When a cloud workspace exposes running services, cmux shows preview links under the run and in the Open With menu. Open a preview link to load it in the Preview page.

## Custom preview URLs
From the run tree, choose "Add preview URL" to add any URL. Each custom URL becomes its own preview tab and can be edited later.

## Notes
- Local Docker runs do not expose the Browser panel.
- Preview links appear only while the service is running.

## Browser preview

Cloud workspaces include a full browser panel. You can interact with your app while the agent is still working—no need to wait for it to finish.

<Note>Live preview is only available for cloud workspaces (web app and desktop app in cloud mode).</Note>

## Preview links

When your dev server is running, cmux shows preview links:
- In the run tree under your run
- In the Open With menu
- Click any link to open it in the Preview page

## Custom preview URLs

Need to preview a specific route or external URL? Add custom preview URLs from the run tree. Each custom URL becomes its own tab that you can edit later.

## Local workspaces

Local Docker runs don't have the browser panel, but you can still access your dev server on localhost as usual.

title: Parallel Agents
description: 'Run multiple agent CLIs in a single task'
---

## Overview
A task can run multiple agent instances at the same time. Each agent instance is a run with its own branch and workspace.

## Selecting agents
- Pick one or more agents when creating a task.
- You can add multiple instances of the same agent; the picker allows up to 6 per agent.
- Agent availability depends on provider credentials.

## Isolation
Each run is isolated:
- Separate git branches and worktrees.
- Separate VS Code, terminal, and processes.
- No shared context between agents.

## Monitoring
Use the task tree and Activity panel to see run status (`pending`, `running`, `completed`, `failed`, `skipped`) and open each run's panels.

## Crown evaluation
After all root runs finish, cmux evaluates the completed runs and crowns a winner.
- If only one run completes, it is crowned automatically.
- If all runs fail or are skipped, crown evaluation ends with `error`.

title: Parallel Agents
description: 'Run multiple agents on the same task'

## The idea

Give the same task to Claude, Codex, and Gemini at the same time. Each one works independently on its own branch. Compare the results and ship the best one.

## How to use it

1. When creating a task, pick multiple agents from the dropdown
2. You can even add multiple copies of the same agent (up to 6 each)
3. Click Start—all agents begin working at once

<Tip>Running 3 copies of Claude Opus often gives you better results than running it once, since each attempt may take a different approach.</Tip>

## Complete isolation

Each agent runs in its own sandbox:
- **Separate branches** — No merge conflicts between agents
- **Separate workspaces** — Each gets its own VS Code and terminal
- **No shared state** — Agents can't see what the others are doing

## Watching progress

The Activity panel shows all runs in a tree view. You'll see:
- **Pending** — Waiting to start
- **Running** — Agent is working
- **Completed** — Done successfully
- **Failed** — Something went wrong

Click any run to open its workspace and see what the agent is doing.

## Picking a winner

When all agents finish, cmux automatically evaluates them and crowns the best one. You can also manually pick a different winner if you prefer a different approach.

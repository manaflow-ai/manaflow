## Overview
cmux includes a heatmap diff viewer that highlights riskier lines and provides AI tooltip explanations. It is available for task run diffs and PR diffs.

## Heatmap review
- Toggle AI Review with the flame icon in the diff header.
- Lines are colored by review score; higher scores appear hotter.
- Hover a highlighted line to see the AI tooltip.

## Models and language
Heatmap models:
- `anthropic-opus-4-5`
- `anthropic`
- `cmux-heatmap-2`
- `cmux-heatmap-1`
- `cmux-heatmap-0`

Tooltip languages:
- `en`, `zh-Hant`, `zh-Hans`, `ja`, `ko`, `es`, `fr`, `de`, `pt`, `ru`
- `hi`, `bn`, `te`, `mr`, `ta`, `gu`, `kn`, `ml`, `pa`, `ar`
- `vi`, `th`, `id`

## Visibility and colors
- Visibility threshold controls how aggressive highlighting is.
- Line and token gradient colors are configurable.

Settings are saved in Settings > Diff Heatmap Review and can also be adjusted in the diff view.

## Screenshot sets
For runs with preview jobs, the diff page shows the latest screenshot set with status (`completed`, `failed`, `skipped`) and whether UI changes were detected.

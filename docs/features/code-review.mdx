## Heatmap review

cmux includes an AI-powered diff viewer that highlights potentially risky changes. Toggle it on with the flame icon in the diff header.

Here's what you get:
- **Color-coded lines** — Hotter colors mean higher risk
- **AI tooltips** — Hover over highlighted lines for explanations
- **Adjustable sensitivity** — Control how aggressive the highlighting is

<Tip>The heatmap is great for catching issues like missing error handling, security concerns, or logic bugs.</Tip>

## Models

Choose your heatmap model in settings:
- `anthropic-opus-4-5` (best quality)
- `anthropic`
- `cmux-heatmap-2`
- `cmux-heatmap-1`
- `cmux-heatmap-0`

## Languages

Tooltips support 20+ languages including English, Chinese (Traditional and Simplified), Japanese, Korean, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Russian, Hindi, Arabic, Vietnamese, Thai, and Indonesian.

## Customization

Adjust these in **Settings > Diff Heatmap Review** or directly in the diff view:
- **Visibility threshold** — How much highlighting to show
- **Line colors** — Gradient colors for the heatmap
- **Token colors** — Colors for inline highlighting

## Screenshot comparisons

For runs with preview jobs, the diff page shows before/after screenshots. You'll see:
- Screenshot status (completed, failed, skipped)
- Whether UI changes were detected
- Side-by-side visual comparison

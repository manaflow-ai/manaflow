## What's an environment?

An environment is a saved cloud workspace you can reuse across tasks. Instead of starting from scratch each time, you can:

- Pre-install dependencies
- Set up your dev server
- Configure environment variables
- Keep data between tasks

## Creating an environment

1. Start a cloud workspace from a repo
2. Set it up how you like (install deps, configure tools)
3. Click **Save as Environment**
4. Give it a name

The environment is now available for future tasks.

## Using an environment

When creating a task:

1. Click **Environment** instead of picking a repo
2. Select your saved environment
3. The task starts with everything pre-configured

## Environment settings

| Setting | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Start command** | Runs when the workspace starts |
| **Dev server command** | Starts your preview server |
| **Port** | Which port to expose for preview |
| **Ready text** | Text that indicates the server is ready |

## Updating an environment

1. Start a task using the environment
2. Make your changes
3. Click **Update Environment** to save the new state

## Sharing environments

Environments are scoped to your team. Anyone on the team can use environments created by other members.

## Limitations

- **Cloud only** — Environments don't work with local workspaces
- **One repo** — Each environment is tied to a single repository
- **Snapshot size** — Large node_modules or build artifacts may slow down startup

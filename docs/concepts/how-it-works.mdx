# How cmux works

cmux turns a task into one or more parallel agent runs. Each run gets its own branch and its own workspace.

## Core objects
- Task: prompt plus repo and base branch, or an environment. Optional description and images.
- Run: a single agent instance for a task. Tracks status, branch, workspace, and PR metadata.
- Workspace: VS Code and terminal for a run. Local (Docker) or cloud.
- Environment: a reusable cloud workspace configuration with scripts, env vars, and snapshots.

## Execution flow
1. Create a task and choose a repo or environment.
2. Select agents and optionally multiple instances per agent.
3. cmux creates a run and branch for each instance.
4. Each run starts a workspace and launches the agent CLI.
5. Review diffs, screenshots, and PRs, then pick a winner if needed.

## Isolation and review
- Runs do not share files or processes.
- Each run has a unique branch and worktree.
- The UI lets you compare runs in Activity and Git Diff panels.

## Local and cloud modes
- Local mode runs workspaces in Docker on your machine.
- Cloud mode runs in a cloud workspace and enables the browser preview.
- The web app uses cloud workspaces only.

## Live state
The UI updates in real time as runs progress and as review data becomes available.

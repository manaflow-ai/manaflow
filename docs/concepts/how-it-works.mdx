title: How cmux Works
description: 'Tasks, runs, and workspaces explained'
---

You give cmux a task. cmux spins up one workspace per agent, each on its own branch. The agents work in parallel, and you pick the best result.

## The basics

| Concept | What it is |
|---------|------------|
| **Task** | Your prompt + the repo and branch (or environment) |
| **Run** | One agent working on the task. Has its own branch, workspace, and status |
| **Workspace** | The agent's VS Code + terminal. Can be local (Docker) or cloud |
| **Environment** | A saved cloud setup you can reuse across tasks |

## How a task runs

1. You describe what you want and pick a repo
2. You choose which agents to run (and how many copies of each)
3. cmux creates a branch and workspace for each agent
4. Each agent starts working in its own isolated environment
5. When they're done, you review the diffs and pick a winner (or let cmux pick)

## Isolation

Agents can't see each other. Each one gets:
- Its own git branch
- Its own file system
- Its own terminal and processes

This means you can safely run the same task against multiple agents without them interfering.

## Local vs cloud

| Mode | Where it runs | Preview URL | Requirements |
|------|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Local** | Docker on your machine | No | Desktop app + Docker |
| **Cloud** | cmux cloud | Yes | None |

The web app always uses cloud. The desktop app lets you choose.

## Real-time updates

Everything updates live—you can watch agents write code, see terminal output, and review diffs as they're created.

## What's a workspace?

Every run gets its own workspace—a complete development environment with VS Code, a terminal, and optionally a browser preview. Workspaces are isolated, so agents running in parallel never step on each other's toes.

## Local vs cloud

| Mode | Where it runs | Browser preview | Requirements |
|------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Local** | Docker on your machine | No | Desktop app + Docker |
| **Cloud** | cmux cloud | Yes | None |

<Note>The web app always uses cloud workspaces. The desktop app lets you choose.</Note>

## Panels

Workspaces have panels you can arrange however you like:

- **Activity** — Timeline and run list
- **Workspace** — VS Code editor
- **Terminal** — Command line access
- **Browser** — Live preview (cloud only)
- **Git Diff** — Review changes

Drag panels to rearrange them, close ones you don't need, or double-click to focus on one.

## Layout options

Pick a layout that works for you: single panel, four panels, two horizontal, two vertical, or various three-panel arrangements. cmux remembers your preference.

## Local workspace paths

Local workspaces live at `~/cmux/<repo>/worktrees/<branch>` by default. You can change this in **Settings > Worktree Location**.

## Linking local to cloud

Working on a cloud run but want to use your local editor? Click "Open local workspace" to create a local copy of the branch. Enable auto-sync to keep it updated as the cloud agent works.

## Container management (desktop app)

Control how Docker containers are managed in **Settings > Container Management**:

- Maximum running containers
- How long to keep containers after completion
- Whether to stop immediately on completion
- Minimum containers to keep alive
- Automatic cleanup on or off

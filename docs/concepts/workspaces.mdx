## What's a workspace?

A workspace is where your agent does its work. It's a complete VS Code environment with:

- Full editor with syntax highlighting and IntelliSense
- Integrated terminal
- Git integration
- Browser preview (cloud only)

## Cloud workspaces

Cloud workspaces run on cmux servers. They're available in both the web app and desktop app.

**What you get:**
- Instant startup
- Live preview URL for testing your app
- No local resources used
- Accessible from anywhere

## Local workspaces (desktop only)

Local workspaces run on your machine using Docker. Only available in the desktop app.

**What you get:**
- Everything stays on your machine
- Full control over the environment
- Works offline
- Uses your local compute

**Requirements:**
- Docker running
- Git installed

## Opening a workspace

Click on any run to open its workspace. You'll see:

- **Editor** — The agent's VS Code session
- **Terminal** — Live output from the agent
- **Preview** — Your app running (cloud only)

## External editors

In the desktop app, you can open any workspace in your local editor:

1. Click the external editor button in the workspace toolbar
2. Choose VS Code, Cursor, or another supported editor
3. The project opens locally with all changes synced

<Tip>This is great for debugging or making manual fixes while the agent is working.</Tip>

## Workspace lifecycle

1. **Created** — Workspace is provisioned when the run starts
2. **Active** — Agent is working, you can watch in real time
3. **Completed** — Run finished, workspace stays available for review
4. **Cleaned up** — Workspace is removed after idle timeout or manual cleanup

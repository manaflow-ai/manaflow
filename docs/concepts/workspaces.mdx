title: Workspaces
description: 'Per-run VS Code environments and panels'

## Overview
Each run gets its own workspace. A workspace is the run's file system plus panels for VS Code, terminal, and an optional browser preview. Workspaces are isolated, so parallel runs do not share files or processes.

## Workspace types

### Local (Docker)
- Runs on your machine with Docker (desktop app only).
- Uses git worktrees on disk.
- Browser preview is not available.

### Cloud
- Runs in a cloud workspace.
- Required for environments and for the browser preview.
- Preview links appear for running services.

### Standalone workspaces
cmux can create local or cloud workspaces that are not tied to an agent prompt. These show only the panels needed for that workspace type.

## Local workspace paths
Local worktrees are stored at `~/cmux/<repo>/worktrees/<branch>` by default. You can change the base path in Settings > Worktree Location (use `~` for your home directory).

## Panels and layout
Available panels:
- Activity (timeline and run list)
- Workspace (VS Code)
- Terminal
- Browser (cloud only)
- Git Diff (task runs only)

Layout options: `single-panel`, `four-panel`, `two-horizontal`, `two-vertical`, `three-left`, `three-right`, `three-top`, `three-bottom`. Layout and split sizes are saved in localStorage.

Panel controls:
- Drag a panel header to swap panels.
- Close a panel with the X button.
- Double-click the header or use the expand icon to focus a panel.

Fixed layouts:
- Local workspaces force `single-panel` (VS Code only).
- Cloud workspaces force `two-horizontal` (VS Code + Browser) and hide Git Diff.

## Linking a local workspace to a cloud run
From a cloud run, use "Open local workspace" to create a local copy of the run's branch. Auto-sync keeps the local workspace updated from the cloud run; toggle it from the task header.

## Container lifecycle (desktop app)
In Settings > Container Management you can control Docker cleanup:
- Maximum running containers.
- Review period after completion.
- Stop immediately on completion.
- Minimum containers to keep alive.
- Automatic cleanup on or off.

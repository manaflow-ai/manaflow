## What's a task?

A task is what you give cmux to work on. It's your prompt plus some context:

| Part | What it is |
|------|------------|
| **Prompt** | What you want the agents to do |
| **Images** | Screenshots or mockups (optional) |
| **Repo + branch** | Where the agents should work |
| **Runs** | One per agent you picked |

## Runs

Each agent gets its own run. A run is completely isolated—its own branch, its own workspace, its own process.

Run statuses:
- **Pending** — Waiting to start
- **Running** — Agent is working
- **Completed** — Done successfully
- **Failed** — Something went wrong
- **Skipped** — Cancelled before starting

<Tip>You can run the same agent multiple times on a single task. Each copy gets its own run.</Tip>

## The crown

When all agents finish, cmux picks a winner and gives it a crown. Here's how it works:

- If multiple agents complete, cmux evaluates them and crowns the best one
- If only one agent completes, it wins automatically
- If all agents fail, no crown is awarded

You can always override the crown and pick a different winner if you prefer a different approach.

## Pull requests

Runs can have pull requests attached:
- **Draft** — PR is open as a draft
- **Open** — PR is ready for review
- **Merged** — PR was merged
- **Closed** — PR was closed without merging

Create a PR from any completed run, or enable auto-PR in settings to open one automatically for the crowned run.

## Images

Attach screenshots or mockups to your task. cmux saves them and makes them available to the agents in their workspaces—they can open the images just like any other file.

## Managing tasks

From the task list or task view:
- **Rename** — Change the task prompt
- **Pin** — Keep important tasks at the top
- **Archive** — Hide completed tasks
- **Archive runs** — Clean up individual runs you don't need

## Notifications

cmux notifies you when:
- A run completes
- A run fails
- An agent needs input

Check your notifications in the Notifications page.

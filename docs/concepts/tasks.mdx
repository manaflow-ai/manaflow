## Task basics

A task is the unit of work you give cmux. It includes:
- Prompt text (stored in `task.text`).
- Optional description and images.
- A repo and base branch, or an environment.
- One or more runs (one per agent instance).

## Runs

A run is a single agent instance for a task.
- Each run has its own branch and workspace.
- Run status is one of: `pending`, `running`, `completed`, `failed`, `skipped`.
- Runs store PR metadata (`pullRequestUrl`, `pullRequests`, `pullRequestState`).
- Runs store screenshot sets and optional AI claims for review.
- Runs can be nested (parent and child runs) and are shown as a tree in the UI.

## Completion and crown evaluation

When all root runs reach a terminal state, the task is marked completed.
- If at least one run completes, cmux evaluates runs and crowns a winner.
- If only one run completes, it is crowned automatically.
- If all runs fail or are skipped, crown evaluation is set to `error`.

Crown evaluation status values:
- `pending`, `in_progress`, `succeeded`, `error`.

Crowned runs store `isCrowned` and `crownReason`.

## PR and merge status

Run PR state values:
- `none`, `draft`, `open`, `merged`, `closed`, `unknown`.

Task merge status values:
- `none`, `pr_draft`, `pr_open`, `pr_approved`, `pr_changes_requested`, `pr_merged`, `pr_closed`.

## Images

You can attach images to a task. cmux stores them and injects file paths into the prompt so agents can open the images from the workspace.

## Task management

From the task list and task view you can:
- Rename the task text.
- Pin and unpin tasks.
- Archive and unarchive tasks.
- Archive individual runs.

## Notifications

cmux creates notifications for:
- `run_completed`
- `run_failed`
- `run_needs_input`

Notifications can be marked read or unread in the Notifications page.

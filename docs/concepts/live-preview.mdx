description: 'Preview your app while agents work'

## Overview

Cloud workspaces give you a live preview URL. Your app runs inside the workspace, and you can access it from any browser.

## How it works

1. Agent starts your dev server (npm run dev, etc.)
2. cmux detects the running server
3. You get a public preview URL
4. The preview updates as the agent makes changes

## Using the preview

**In cmux:** Click the Preview tab in the workspace view to see your app inline.

**External:** Copy the preview URL and open it in any browser. Great for testing on mobile or sharing with teammates.

## Configuring your dev server

cmux tries to detect your dev server automatically. If it doesn't, you can set it up in your environment config:

- **Start command** — The command to start your server
- **Port** — The port your server runs on
- **Ready text** — Text that indicates the server is ready

See [Environments](/features/environments) for details.

## Limitations

- **Cloud only** — Local workspaces don't have preview URLs
- **HTTP only** — HTTPS not currently supported for preview
- **Public URLs** — Anyone with the URL can access the preview while it's running

<Tip>Preview URLs are unique per workspace and change each time a new workspace is created.</Tip>

description: 'Full VS Code in your browser'

## Overview

Every workspace includes a complete VS Code instance running in your browser. It's the same editor you use locally, with all the features you'd expect.

## What's included

- **Syntax highlighting** for all major languages
- **IntelliSense** with autocomplete and hover docs
- **File explorer** for navigating the codebase
- **Search** across all files
- **Git integration** showing changed files
- **Terminal** with full shell access
- **Extensions** pre-installed for common tasks

## Watching the agent

When an agent is running, you can watch it work in real time:

- See files being created and modified
- Watch the terminal output
- See git commits as they happen

The editor updates live—no refresh needed.

## Taking control

You can interact with the workspace while an agent is working:

- Type in the terminal
- Open and edit files
- Run commands

<Warning>Manually editing files while an agent is working may confuse the agent or cause conflicts. Use this carefully.</Warning>

## External editors

In the desktop app, click the external editor button to open the workspace in your local VS Code, Cursor, or other editor. Changes sync back automatically.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Standard VS Code shortcuts work:

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Command palette | `Cmd+Shift+P` |
| Quick open | `Cmd+P` |
| Find in file | `Cmd+F` |
| Find in project | `Cmd+Shift+F` |
| Save | `Cmd+S` |

## Connecting GitHub

Go to **Settings → Connected Accounts** and click **Connect GitHub**. You'll be redirected to authorize the cmux GitHub app.

## What cmux can do

Once connected:

- **Read repos** — Access your public and private repositories
- **Create branches** — Make branches for agent work
- **Push code** — Push agent commits
- **Create PRs** — Open pull requests on your behalf
- **Read CI status** — See GitHub Actions results

## Repository access

You can grant access to:

- **All repositories** — cmux can access everything
- **Selected repositories** — Only specific repos you choose

Change this anytime in your GitHub settings.

## Organization repos

For org repos, an admin may need to approve the cmux app first. If you don't see an org repo:

1. Check if the cmux app is approved for your org
2. Ask an admin to approve it
3. Or use a personal fork

## Disconnecting

To disconnect:

1. Go to **Settings → Connected Accounts**
2. Click **Disconnect** next to GitHub
3. Optionally revoke the app in your GitHub settings

## Troubleshooting

**Can't see a repo?**
- Check if you granted access to that repo
- For org repos, verify the app is approved
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting

**PR creation fails?**
- Make sure you have write access to the repo
- Check if branch protection rules are blocking

**CI status not showing?**
- Verify GitHub Actions is enabled for the repo
- Check if the cmux app has workflow permissions

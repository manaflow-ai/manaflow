## The heatmap

cmux analyzes every diff and highlights risky changes:

- **Red** — High risk, review carefully
- **Yellow** — Medium risk, worth checking
- **Green** — Low risk, probably fine

The heatmap helps you focus on the parts that matter most.

## What it looks for

The AI evaluates:

- Logic changes that could introduce bugs
- Security-sensitive code (auth, crypto, input handling)
- Breaking changes to APIs or interfaces
- Complex control flow that's hard to verify

## Using the diff viewer

1. Open any completed run
2. Click the **Git Diff** tab
3. Toggle the heatmap on/off
4. Hover over highlighted lines to see why they're flagged

## Side-by-side comparison

When multiple agents complete, you can compare their solutions:

- Switch between runs in the diff viewer
- See how each agent approached the problem
- Pick the cleanest solution

## Making the final call

The heatmap is a guide, not a replacement for human review. Always check:

- Does the code do what you asked?
- Are there edge cases the agent missed?
- Does it match your codebase style?

## Overview

Each agent needs credentials to run. Go to **Settings → API Key Authentication** to add your keys.

## Keys by agent

### Claude Code
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — Get one from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
- Or `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` — From Claude Code CLI auth

### Codex CLI
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — Get one from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
- Or `CODEX_AUTH_JSON` — The full contents of `~/.codex/auth.json`

### Gemini CLI
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` — Get one from [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com)

### Amp
- `AMP_API_KEY` — From Sourcegraph

### Cursor
- `CURSOR_API_KEY` — From Cursor settings

### Opencode
Depends on the model:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for Anthropic models
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` for OpenAI models
- `XAI_API_KEY` for Grok models
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` for OpenRouter models

## Adding a key

1. Go to **Settings → API Key Authentication**
2. Find the key you need
3. Enter your key value
4. Click **Save**

## Key security

- Keys are encrypted at rest
- Keys are injected into workspaces at runtime
- Keys are never logged or exposed in code
- Keys are scoped to your team

## Checking status

**Settings → Provider Status** shows which agents are ready:

- ✅ All requirements met
- ❌ Missing key or local config

If an agent shows as unavailable, check what's missing and add the required key.

## Local credentials

Some agents can also use credentials from your local machine (desktop app only):

- Claude Code: `~/.claude.json` and keychain
- Codex: `~/.codex/auth.json`
- Gemini: `~/.gemini/settings.json`
- Amp: `~/.local/share/amp/secrets.json`
- Cursor: `~/.config/cursor/auth.json` and keychain

cmux checks these automatically if no API key is set in Settings.

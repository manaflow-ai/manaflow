## Automatic branching

When a task starts, each agent gets its own branch:

```
cmux/<task-name>-<agent>-<random>
```

Branches are created from your selected base branch. Agents push commits as they work.

## Viewing diffs

Open the **Git Diff** tab to see what changed:

- Side-by-side or unified view
- Syntax highlighting
- AI-powered heatmaps showing risky changes

## Creating pull requests

From any completed run:

1. Click **Create PR**
2. Choose the target branch
3. Review the auto-generated title and description
4. Click **Create**

cmux creates the PR on GitHub and links it to the run.

## Managing PRs

Once a PR exists:

- **View on GitHub** — Opens the PR in a new tab
- **Merge** — Merge, squash, or rebase directly from cmux
- **Close** — Close without merging

## CI status

If your repo has GitHub Actions, cmux shows the check status:

- ✅ All checks passed
- ❌ Some checks failed
- ⏳ Checks running

Click the status to see details on GitHub.

## Branch cleanup

After merging, cmux can delete the agent's branch automatically. Enable this in task settings.

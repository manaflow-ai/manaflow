## Web app

Open cmux in your browser and sign in. The web app runs everything in cloud workspaces—no setup required.

## Desktop app

Download the app from the cmux website and install it. The desktop app gives you:

- **Local workspaces** — Run agents on your machine with Docker
- **Cloud workspaces** — Same as the web app
- **Local editors** — Open workspaces in VS Code, Cursor, or your favorite editor

<Note>Local workspaces are only available in the desktop app.</Note>

## Requirements for local workspaces

To run agents locally, you'll need:

- **Docker** — Running and accessible
- **Git** — Installed

That's it. cmux handles the rest.

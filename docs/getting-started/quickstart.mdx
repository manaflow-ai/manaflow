## 1. Open cmux
- Web app: open the cmux web app and sign in.
- Desktop app: install the app, launch it, and sign in.

## 2. Connect GitHub (optional but required for private repos and PRs)
Go to Settings > Connected Accounts and connect GitHub. If you want repo listing and PR actions, install the GitHub App when prompted in the repo picker.

## 3. Add agent credentials
Go to Settings > API Key Authentication and add the keys for the agents you plan to run.

## 4. Select a repo or environment
Use the repository picker. You can paste a public GitHub URL. Selecting an environment uses cloud workspaces.

## 5. Choose a base branch
Pick the branch agents should start from. This is required for repo tasks and skipped for environments.

## 6. Write the task
Enter a prompt. Attach images in the editor if you need visual context.

## 7. Select agents
Pick one or more agents. You can add multiple instances of the same agent.

## 8. Choose local or cloud mode (desktop only)
- Local mode uses Docker.
- Cloud mode runs in a cloud workspace and enables the browser preview.

## 9. Start the task
Click Start or press Cmd+Enter (or Ctrl+Enter).

## 10. Review the results
- Activity panel shows the run timeline and crown evaluation.
- Workspace and Terminal show live changes.
- Git Diff shows changes and heatmap highlights.
- Open draft PRs and merge from the PR view when ready.

## 1. Open cmux

**Web:** Go to the cmux web app and sign in.

**Desktop:** Download the app, open it, and sign in.

## 2. Connect GitHub

Go to **Settings → Connected Accounts** and connect your GitHub. This lets you access private repos and create PRs.

<Note>You can skip this for public repos, but you won't be able to open PRs.</Note>

## 3. Add your API keys

Go to **Settings → API Key Authentication** and add keys for the agents you want to use (Claude, OpenAI, etc.).

## 4. Pick a repo

Click the repo picker and choose a repository. You can also paste any public GitHub URL.

## 5. Pick a branch

Choose which branch the agents should start from. They'll create new branches off of this one.

## 6. Describe what you want

Type your task in plain English. You can attach screenshots if that helps explain what you need.

## 7. Choose your agents

Pick one or more agents—Claude, Codex, Gemini, whatever you have keys for. You can even run multiple copies of the same agent to compare outputs.

## 8. Cloud or local? (desktop only)

- **Cloud** — Runs in the cloud. You get a live preview URL.
- **Local** — Runs on your machine with Docker. No preview, but everything stays local.

## 9. Start the task

Click **Start** or press `Cmd+Enter` (`Ctrl+Enter` on Windows).

## 10. Watch and review

- **Activity** — See the timeline and which agent wins the crown
- **Workspace** — Watch agents code in real time
- **Git Diff** — Review changes with AI heatmaps
- **PR** — Open a pull request and merge when ready

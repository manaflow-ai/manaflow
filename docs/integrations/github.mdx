## Two ways to connect

GitHub integration has two parts:

| Connection | What it does |
|------------|--------------|
| **GitHub OAuth** | Lets you clone private repos |
| **GitHub App** | Powers repo listing and PR operations |

## Connect your account

Go to **Settings > Connected Accounts** and click "Connect GitHub." On desktop, this opens in your browser. On web, it redirects.

## Install the GitHub App

From the repo picker, click "Install GitHub App" and choose which org or user to install it for. The app installation determines which repos show up in the picker.

<Tip>You only need to install the app once per org. After that, all repos from that org appear in your picker.</Tip>

## Picking repos

Two ways to select a repo:
- Pick from the list (synced from your app installation)
- Paste a GitHub URL or `owner/repo` (works for public repos)

## Branches and PRs

Once connected, cmux can:
- Show all branches in the branch picker
- Detect the default branch
- Create, view, merge, and close pull requests

## Checks and deployments

PR diff views show GitHub Actions status, check runs, deployments, and commit status—so you can see if CI passed before merging.

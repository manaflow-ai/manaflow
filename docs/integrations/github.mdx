## Overview
GitHub integration has two parts: GitHub OAuth (your user account) and the cmux GitHub App (repo access). OAuth is required for private repo cloning; the App powers repo listing and PR operations.

## Connect GitHub
- Go to Settings > Connected Accounts and connect GitHub.
- In the desktop app the flow opens in your system browser; in web it redirects.

## Install the GitHub App
- From the repository picker, click "Install GitHub App" and choose the org or user.
- The app installation determines which repos appear in the picker.

## Repository selection
- Pick repos from the list synced from the app installation.
- You can also paste a GitHub URL or owner/repo for public repos.

## Branches and PRs
- Branch pickers and default branch detection use the GitHub API.
- PR views and actions (open, merge, close) require the app installation.

## Checks and deployments
PR diff views show GitHub Actions, check runs, deployments, and commit status for the linked PR.

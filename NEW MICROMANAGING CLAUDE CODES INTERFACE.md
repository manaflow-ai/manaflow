NEW MICROMANAGING CLAUDE CODES INTERFACE

Interface is like this:
- Today we have many Claude Code's running in their own isolated sandbox envrionemtns
- No way of really knowing what each Claude Code is currently working on because 1:many
- As a result most tasks done in the cloud are usually one off tasks are tasks that developers think a Claude Code can zero shot... or one shot with a lot of progress
- The fact is that many developers want to MICROMANAGE their claude code sessions and watch them as they work and direct them when they go off the rails. This is because [a] Model Intelligence is not good enough today, which the AI labs are solving and [b] Models don't know what questions to ask a human when it is not 100 percent confident on user intent, implementation details. Humans want to be in the loop of what Claude Code writes but they are not in it today.
- So we propose a new type of interface in which you have one Claude Code manager that peers its head into the isolated Claude Codes in their own sandbox environments and tells it to use the "AskUserQuestionTool" once in a while so that Claude Codes are forced to reflect on what approaches they are doing and ask good questions to the user. The good questions, or important ones, are surfaced the human by the orchestrator and the bad ones, or ones that can be answered by itself or through some basic search functions, should NOT be surfaced the user. The idea is that these questions, given enough cntext, should be sufficient to explain to the human the context and what the AI is currently working on so the human is still technically in the loop albeit at a higher management level.
- Today ppl use IDE tools like Cursor and VSCode because they like babysitting AI for the deep work tasks and leave the easy tasks for asynchronous agents in the cloud (the ones that they don't need micromanaging because the task is well defined and clear). But for a set of tasks where it is not so well defined, clear, and a bit cloudy, we consider this to be deep work. And these deep work tasks we want to be done in an interface kind of as an intermediary between babysitting and not babysitting. We like to think of it as babysitting only when necessary.
- The best way to build this interface is leveraging Claude Agent SDK and creating a new CLI to do this... 
- We want to balance the amount of information surfaced to the user with the amount of questions surfaced to the user. This is a very important thing that we must get right.
- Spec driven development is the future. But what if the spec is unclear to the human? What can we do interface wise to solve this issue? If there is a good spec, then we can just send it off to an async agent. But most specs are not clear to the human at the start, it's through the process of search and experimentation and iteration that they discover. How can we replicate the process but make it multiprocessable... like humans can do mulitple of this at the same time without sacrificing quality.
- Is a CLI the best interface to do this? How will this work in the broader scheme of cmux, what do we need to redesign in order for this interface to work? How can we get a basic MVP out as soon as possible so we can test this hypothesis out.
- What should this interface even look like? Any ideas on implementation directions... 
- I think the best way to do this and make an MVP is using Claude Agent SDK and the New CLI...

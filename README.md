<p align="center">open source Claude Code manager that supports Codex/Gemini/Cursor/OpenCode/Amp CLI</p>

<p align="center"><code>bunx cmux</code> or <code>npx cmux</code></p>

cmux lets you spawn Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor CLI, Gemini CLI, Amp, Opencode, and other coding agent CLIs in parallel across multiple tasks.

Each agent runs in its own Docker container, launching VS Code with a Git diff UI and a terminal for its CLI.
